## Repository

This repository includes the scripts for TileMill and the Overpass-turbo.eu queries need to make the projection. The *srtm-3785-contour.shp* file is not included in this repository, because of its file size. Please create it yourself by following the instructions of [Steve Bennett](http://stevebennett.me/2013/09/11/terrain-in-tilemill-a-walkthrough-for-non-gis-types/).

Feel free to use scripts and images.
